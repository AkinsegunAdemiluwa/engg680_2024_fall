##Automated Detection of Roads and Pathways
This project focuses on the automated detection of roads and pathways from aerial or satellite imagery using machine learning techniques. The solution aims to assist in urban planning, disaster management, and navigation by efficiently identifying and classifying road networks.

##Key Features
Preprocessing and Feature Extraction: Techniques to enhance and prepare the input imagery for analysis.
Model Training and Evaluation: Application of supervised machine learning algorithms to classify road and non-road regions accurately.
Performance Optimization: Methods to refine models for improved accuracy and efficiency.

##Tools and Technologies
Python
OpenCV for image processing
Machine learning frameworks such as Scikit-learn or TensorFlow
GIS tools for mapping and analysis

##Use Cases
Urban planning and infrastructure development
Disaster response and evacuation planning
Autonomous vehicle navigation

##How to Use
