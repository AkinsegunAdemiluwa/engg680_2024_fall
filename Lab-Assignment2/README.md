Assignment 1:This assignment focused on Least Squares Estimation (LSE) for Satellite Positioning. It includes computational steps to estimate states, corrections, residuals, and covariance matrices. After convergence, it requires plotting misclosures, corrections, and position errors over iterations. Commentary on the variance of unit weight and covariance matrix is also required. Finally, there is an optional step to visualize the receiver's position in Earth-centered coordinates.
